# Global Register of Introduced and Invasive Species - Belgium

## Rationale

This repository contains the functionality to create and standardize the _Global Register of Introduced and Invasive Species - Belgium_ to a [Darwin Core checklist](https://www.gbif.org/dataset-classes) that can be harvested by [GBIF](http://www.gbif.org).

This unified checklist is the result of two open and reproducible data pipelines developed for the TrIAS project (http://trias-project.be). In the data publication pipeline, we use the [Checklist recipe](https://github.com/trias-project/checklist-recipe/wiki) to standardize and publish a selection of authoritative species checklists as Darwin Core Archives to GBIF. Predominantly, these checklists record the presence of alien species in Belgium for a specific taxon group or habitat and are maintained by their respective authors. In the data processing pipeline, we extract all Belgian non-native taxa from these checklists and unify their taxonomy using the [GBIF Backbone Taxonomy](https://doi.org/10.15468/39omei). This automated process is implemented and documented at https://trias-project.github.io/unified-checklist/ The sources used for the unified checklist are:

1. Manual of the Alien Plants of Belgium ([Verloove et al. 2018](https://doi.org/10.15468/wtda1m))
2. Checklist of alien birds of Belgium ([Preda et al. 2019](https://doi.org/10.15468/wr3gis))
3. Checklist of non-native freshwater fishes in Flanders, Belgium ([Verreycken et al. 2018](https://doi.org/10.15468/xvuzfh))
4. Checklist of alien herpetofauna of Belgium ([van Doorn et al. 2021](https://doi.org/10.15468/pnxu4c))
5. Inventory of alien macroinvertebrates in Flanders, Belgium ([Boets et al. 2018](https://doi.org/10.15468/yxcq07))
6. Registry of introduced terrestrial molluscs in Belgium ([Backeljau et al. 2019](https://doi.org/10.15468/t13kwo))
7. Checklist of alien species in the Scheldt estuary in Flanders, Belgium ([Soors et al. 2021](https://doi.org/10.15468/8zq9s4))
8. Catalogue of the Rust Fungi of Belgium ([Vanderweyen et al. 2018](https://doi.org/10.15468/2dboyn))
9. WRiMS: World Register of Introduced Marine Species ([Flanders Marine Institute 2019](https://doi.org/10.14284/347))
10. Ad hoc checklist of alien species in Belgium ([Reyserhove et al. 2018](https://doi.org/10.15468/3pmlxs))
11. RINSE - Pathways and vectors of biological invasions in Northwest Europe ([Zieritz et al. 2018](https://doi.org/10.15468/guejza))

## Repo structure

The repository structure is based on [Cookiecutter Data Science](http://drivendata.github.io/cookiecutter-data-science/) and the [Checklist recipe](https://github.com/trias-project/checklist-recipe). Files and directories indicated with `GENERATED` should not be edited manually.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your computer
2. Open the RStudio project file
3. Open the `index.Rmd` [R Markdown file](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) in RStudio
4. Install any required packages
6. Click `Build > Build Book` to generate the processed data and build the website in `docs/`

## Publication

To publish an update of the dataset:

1. Open the [resource in the IPT](https://ipt.inbo.be/manage/resource.do?r=unified-checklist) (login required)
2. `Source data`: upload the newly generated data files from `data/processed`
3. `Darwin Core mappings`: does not require updates, unless terms were added/removed in the pipeline
4. `Metadata`: does not require updates, except for:
    - `Basic metadata`: in description, check if number of taxa (2.500+) still applies
    - `Taxonomic coverage`: in description, update numbers per kingdom based on [new data](https://trias-project.github.io/unified-checklist/6_dwc_mapping.html#preview-data)
    - `Temporal coverage`: update `End date` if need be
5. Publish: click `Publish`, add a short description and publish
6. Check if [dataset is updated](https://www.gbif.org/dataset/6d9e952f-948c-4483-9807-575348147c7e) at GBIF (can take a couple of hours)
