Here we choose the checklists we want to include and rank them by trust (most trustworthy first). The ranking will help to choose between duplicate taxa in later steps. Choose checklists: checklist_keys &lt;- c( &quot;9ff7d317-609b-4c08-bd86-3bc404b77c42&quot;, # alien-plants-belgium &quot;289244ee-e1c1-49aa-b2d7-d379391ce265&quot;, # alien-macroinvertebrates &quot;98940a79-2bf1-46e6-afd6-ba2e85a26f9f&quot;, # alien-fishes-checklist &quot;e082b10e-476f-43c1-aa61-f8d92f33029a&quot;, # alien-mollusca-checklist &quot;e1c3be64-2799-4342-8312-49d076993132&quot;, # alien-birds-checklist &quot;0a2eaf0c-5504-4f48-a47f-c94229029dc8&quot;, # wrims-checklist &quot;b043c480-dd36-4f4f-aa82-e188753ff09d&quot;, # uredinales-belgium-checklist &quot;1f3505cd-5d98-4e23-bd3b-ffe59d05d7c2&quot;, # ad-hoc-checklist &quot;1738f272-6b5d-4f43-9a92-453a8c5ea50a&quot; # rinse-pathways-checklist ) Add the GBIF Backbone Taxonomy. Note: we won’t use this as a source checklist, but we need its metadata in the Darwin Core mapping. checklist_keys &lt;- append(checklist_keys, &quot;d7dddbf4-2cf0-4f39-9b2a-bb099caae36c&quot;) Get metadata for these checklists from GBIF and display the result: Remove accessed via GBIF.org on yyyy-mm-dd. from citation (we want the static citation of the dataset). Save to CSV. Remove the GBIF Backbone Taxonomy for further querying steps. 1.2 Get taxa Get taxa from these checklists from GBIF. Note: here we get checklist taxa, not GBIF backbone taxa. Keep only source taxa, not denormed higher classification taxa (= taxa added by GBIF if kingdom, phylum, etc. was populated) Keep only taxa that are not considered synonyms by source checklist. Select columns of interest, rename key to taxonKey. Convert the column issues from a list to a concatenated string. Preview checklist taxa: 1.3 Filter on distributions TrIAS checklists can contain more than alien species in Belgium. We therefore need to filter on the associated distribution information. Note: we filter on distribution information of checklist taxa, not GBIF backbone taxa. That is because backbone taxa contain distribution information from TrIAS checklists and other checklists, which we don’t want to consider here. E.g. compare: Distributions for checklist taxon Eriocheir sinensis (140563012) Distributions for backbone taxon Eriocheir sinensis (2225776) Note: if a checklist has related information for a taxon, but not a valid distribution, that related information will NOT be included in the unified checklist. This is to exclude related information about a taxon for which the checklist did not even consider a Belgian scope (e.g. pathway). Get distributions for our taxa from GBIF. Filter distributions on present, alien species in Belgium: distributions &lt;- distributions %&gt;% filter( country == &quot;BE&quot;, establishmentMeans %in% c(&quot;INTRODUCED&quot;, &quot;NATURALISED&quot;, &quot;INVASIVE&quot;, &quot;ASSISTED COLONISATION&quot;), !status %in% c(&quot;ABSENT&quot;, &quot;EXCLUDED&quot;, &quot;DOUBTFUL&quot;) # Inverse filter! ) Save distributions to CSV. Based on the filtered distributions, assign a validDistribution (TRUE/FALSE) column to the taxa. Preview some taxa with not a single valid distribution (taxonKey can be used to verify manually on GBIF): Rename nubKey to bb_key and move to the end. 1.4 Get GBIF backbone taxonomy information A taxon can occur on more than one checklist. To identify these duplicates, we cannot rely on the scientific name as there might be spelling variations (e.g. with or without authorship) and it does not account for synonyms that should be lumped with the accepted taxon. To have unifying taxon identifiers across taxa, we rely on the GBIF backbone taxonomy, to which every checklist taxon (re)published to GBIF is automatically matched. If a match in the backbone is found, the checklist taxon will have a nubKey. Filter taxa on having valid distribution and nubKey and create vector of unique nubKeys. Get GBIF backbone taxonomy information. Rename accepted to acceptedName. Add prefix bb_ to column names. Select columns of interest. Join backbone information with checklist taxa. Note: this can attach information to taxa with validDistribution = FALSE that share a bb_key with other taxa.

["3_verify_taxa.html", "3 Verify taxa 3.1 Read taxa 3.2 Read verification information 3.3 Run and save verification 3.4 Show verification status", " 3 Verify taxa In this chapter we verify taxonomic information returned by the GBIF Backbone Taxonomy. We do this because we want to use the backbone information to unify taxa that can be considered the same within or across checklists. This is straightforward for (accepted) taxa with the same backbone key (bb_key), but requires verification for taxa the backbone does not recognize (no backbone match) or will lump under another name (synonyms). See 3.2. 3.1 Read taxa Read taxa from data/interim/taxa_with_verification.csv. 3.2 Read verification information Verification information consists of a manually assigned verificationKey for taxa the backbone does not recognize (no backbone match) or will lump under another name (synonyms). Those checklist/backbone/accepted taxon combinations are stored in references/verification.tsv, which was created/updated in previous runs of this chapter and then manually annoted with a verificationKey. 3.3 Run and save verification Use the existing verification information to verify taxa with the function trias::verify_taxa: verification &lt;- trias::verify_taxa(taxa, verification) Note: to start a verification from scratch, use trias::verify_taxa(taxa). Save taxa with populated verificationKey back to data/interim/taxa_with_verification.csv. Save updated verification back to references/verification.tsv (sorted on scientificName) 3.4 Show verification status 3.4.1 Unmatched taxa Status Number of taxa Verified 1 Unverified 81 New in this run 0 No longer used 6 Unmatched taxa are those for which the automatic backbone matching on the scientific name failed (have BACKBONE_MATCH_NONE in issues), either because the scientific name could not be parsed or because it is not listed in the backbone. Verification (see 3.2) involves setting the verificationKey to a manually found bb_key. One could even set multiple bb_keys, e.g. to split a hybrid formula into its hybrid parents. 3.4.2 Synonyms Status Number of taxa Previously verified 196 Unverified 229 New in this run 0 No longer used 92 Synonyms are taxa that the backbone will lump under an accepted taxon (taxonomicStatus = SYNONYM or similar). This lumping is often correct, but should be verified. Verification (see 3.2) involves setting the verifiedKey to one of the following: accepted bb_key suggested by GBIF: backbone synonymy is accepted and taxon will be lumped. another accepted bb_key: backbone synonymy is rejected, but taxon will be lumped under another name. bb_key of taxon itself: backbone synonymy is rejected, taxon will be considered as separate taxon. 3.4.3 Accepted taxa Status Number of taxa Verified (automatic) 2869 Unverified 0 Accepted taxa are those the backbone considers own entities (taxonomicStatus = ACCEPTED or DOUBTFUL) that won’t be lumped. No verification is required for these: verificationKey is automatically set to their bb_key. 3.4.4 Erroneous verificationKeys Provided verification keys that are not found in the GBIF backbone: 3.4.5 Additional information Additional information regarding the verification information that is of no further consequence. Duplicate taxa (having same bb_key and bb_acceptedKey) that are quick wins to verify: Previously listed synonyms for which the scientific name was updated in the backbone: Previously listed synonyms for which the accepted scientific name was updated in the backbone: "],

Because of the scope (see 1.3) of the dataset, we can set all distributions to occurrenceStatus:present and establishmentMeans:introduced. 6.5.2.1 taxonID distribution %&lt;&gt;% mutate(dwc_taxonID = paste0(&quot;https://www.gbif.org/species/&quot;, verificationKey)) 6.5.2.2 locationID distribution %&lt;&gt;% mutate(dwc_locationID = locationId) 6.5.2.3 locality distribution %&lt;&gt;% mutate(dwc_locality = locality) 6.5.2.4 countryCode distribution %&lt;&gt;% mutate(dwc_countryCode = &quot;BE&quot;) 6.5.2.5 occurrenceStatus distribution %&lt;&gt;% mutate(dwc_occurrenceStatus = &quot;present&quot;) 6.5.2.6 establishmentMeans distribution %&lt;&gt;% mutate(dwc_establishmentMeans = &quot;introduced&quot;) 6.5.2.7 eventDate The distribution information applies to a certain date range, which we will express here as an ISO 8601 date yyyy/yyyy (startYear/endYear). How the information for startYear and endYear is extracted from the source checklists, is described in 5.3. As a result, each taxon in input_distribution has or an startYear and an endYear or no eventDate information at all. distribution %&lt;&gt;% mutate(dwc_eventDate = case_when( is.na(startYear) &amp; is.na(endYear) ~ &quot;&quot;, TRUE ~ paste(startYear, endYear, sep = &quot;/&quot;) )) Minimum year: 1201 Maximum year: 2018 6.5.2.8 source A distribution can have multiple source taxa (i.e. two verified synonyms from the same checklist). We therefore separate datasetKeys and scientificNames in a maximum of three columns and build a source (see 6.3) for each. Combine three source columns and remove NA: distribution %&lt;&gt;% mutate( dwc_source = paste(source_1, source_2, source_3, sep = &quot; | &quot;) %&gt;% str_remove_all(&quot; \\\\| NA&quot;) ) 6.5.3 Post-processing Only keep the Darwin Core columns.

Together with the accepted names, such a list allows to search for non-native scientific names in e.g. occurrence databases. 8.1 Get unified taxa Read data/interim/taxa_unified.csv. Define columns of interest. Select/rename columns of interest. 8.2 Find synonyms Retrieve all synonyms (from the GBIF Backbone Taxonomy) of the taxa in our list. Synonym taxa won’t return results, but are fine to leave in the list. Note: this step can take few minutes. Select columns of interest in synonyms. Merge input taxa with their synonyms. Save as CSV.
